# Caeser-cipher-encoder

The caesar cipher is a type of encryption in which each letter of the message is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.

This project is included in the portfolio of projects of the Cat√≥lica Coding Club.
